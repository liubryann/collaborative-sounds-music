**How To Test the App**

1. On the login page, you will likely need to sign up for an account.
2. You can check your email for an email for signing up (might be sent to spam)
3. Login to the app using your username and password.
4. Create a composition
5. Add instruments, test out the UI and click on the tones and use the play button to play the sound. Left click on UI to add a note, right click to change the note.
6. Try out the record feature by running for some time and clicking again to have a modal popup for export settings.
7. Try out the Chat Bot features by clicking on the button at the top left.
8. (Create another account, email and username must be unique) Try out sharing by sharing with another user's email. The other user should see an email with a link to the composition (similar to Google Docs) only works with emails that have accounts.
9. Have both (or more) accounts working on the same composition and evaluate the collaboration recognition features (again similar to Google Docs location knowledge).
10. Message us if you wnat access to the Sentry
